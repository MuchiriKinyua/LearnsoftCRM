# CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT </br>
## Overview </br>
The system being developed is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application for managing various business operations, with a focus on employee management and daily report tracking. The system allows employees to submit daily reports and manage client-lead interactions and product orders. Various features have been integrated into the system to facilitate the efficient management of employee performance and business processes. </br>

## Key functionalities include: </br>

Employee Management: CRUD operations for employees, including face verification for attendance. </br>
Daily Reporting: Employees submit daily reports detailing their tasks, which are saved in the system for future reference. </br>
Lead and Client Management: Leads are linked to clients and products, with reporting functionality based on products and employee orders. </br>

## Problem Statement </br>
The primary goal of the system is to automate and streamline business operations such as attendance management, reporting, and client-lead-product interactions. Specific challenges addressed include: </br>

Daily Reporting: The need for employees to submit daily reports and for managers to have easy access to these reports, ensuring timely updates on performance. </br>
Lead-Product Tracking: Ensuring that orders are linked to leads and employees, and that product availability is filtered based on the leadâ€™s selection. </br>

## Major Objective </br>
The major objective of this system is to automate business processes, ensuring efficient employee attendance tracking, daily report generation, and product management. The system should: </br>

Enable daily reporting with a focus on employee performance and productivity. </br>
Ensure lead-to-client and order-to-product management is smooth and transparent, with proper tracking mechanisms in place. </br>

## Specific Objectives </br>
Daily Report Submission: </br>
Enable employees to submit reports for specific days (Monday to Friday). </br>
Store daily reports for each employee, allowing managers to review them based on specific dates. </br>
Provide an option to view reports for the entire week with a combined summary. </br>

Lead and Client Management: </br>
Implement a system to track leads and associate them with products, employees, and clients. </br>
Allow employees to update product and client details when making orders, ensuring that the correct products are linked to leads and clients. </br>

User Experience: </br>
Provide an intuitive interface for employees to submit reports and for admins to manage and review them. </br>

## Conclusions </br>
The system has successfully integrated: </br>

Daily report functionality, allowing employees to submit reports for each day of the week, with a consolidated weekly summary. </br>
Client and lead management, ensuring smooth order processing and product selection. </br>
By automating these processes, the system not only reduces manual errors but also provides detailed reports that assist in decision-making. Employees are now able to submit reports digitally. </br>

## Recommendations </br>
Mobile App Development: </br>
A mobile app version could be developed, allowing employees to mark attendance and submit reports on the go, especially in remote locations. </br>

Weekly and Monthly Reports: </br>
The current system tracks daily reports, but adding a feature for weekly/monthly performance reviews could help managers get a better overview of employee productivity. </br>

Additional User Roles: </br>
Expand the role-based access control to allow more specific permissions, such as creating a role for HR to only view attendance and reports without modifying them. </br>

Integration with HR and Payroll Systems: </br>
Integrate the attendance system with HR and payroll systems, allowing automatic payroll generation based on attendance data. </br>

Enhance the Reporting Features: </br>
Introduce a report approval system, where managers review reports before they are finalized, which will ensure better data validation and reduce errors. </br>

By addressing these recommendations, the system can be enhanced to provide even more value to the organization, improving both employee management and operational efficiency.
